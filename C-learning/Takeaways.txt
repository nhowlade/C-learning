Pointers are variables that hold the address of other variables.

A String is an array of chars and so when accessing a string in 
an array of strings you would want it to be referenced with a double
char pointer.

Calloc is a function similar to that in function like malloc, but the difference
is that it also initialises the memory after allocating it.

Pointer arithmetic refers to the pointer variable and adding 1 to it moves
the pointer to next element by incrementing it by taking into account the
size of the type of value it is pointing to.
